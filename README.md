# python-blackjack
A Simple BlackJack game with Python.

To play the game, run the script in a Python environment. You'll be prompted to play a game of Blackjack. Press 'y' to play and 'n' to exit.

During the game, you'll see your cards and the computer's first card. You'll have the option to draw another card ('y') or pass ('n'). Once you're done drawing cards, the computer will play its turn.

After both the user and computer finish their turns, the final hands and scores will be displayed, and the winner will be determined.

**Have fun playing Blackjack!**
